# 🧽 Spoonge
This is an open source discord bot. I am creating it with the new Discord command type `slash command` (/) and I am trying to improve it more and more to make a bot with as many options as possible. The bot uses mongodb clusters, but in the future I will include the option to use mysql. When the bot has more functions I will publish it so that anyone can add it to their server directly.
